This entire repo has 1 purpose, to host all python projects/interesting studies I am working on. 
The interface.py is a basic interface I am trying to implement, to combine the rest of hte files.
I sometimes come back to this to work, but infrequently due to my lack of interest in python ATM.

I will now be appending this repository with java

## Next steps
My current plan outline as of 6/10/2025:
* java.calc will be hosting calc functions and classes
* ~~python for a system interface due to its simplicity~~ i do not have the time to figure out the integration of both
* java.interface will be having the interface, due to java's **easy** and *fun* quirks of being so long to write stuff
* additional programs as necessary

CALC INFO:
Program opens with terminal setup,
User enters commands, it enters that calc and stays until keyboard intercept captures enter,
Results are directly outputted.

Cases:
    For sin,cos,tan, etc; user will input rad or deg at beginning of calculations, then it will stay until keyboard intercept.
    
    Try-Except blocks will be necessary for catching of errors; a programmic or mathmatical error MUST return to terminal screen as otherwise the program will be ungracefully breaking in a net negative manner, which is not my intent.
